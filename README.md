# WAC-Pasiphae

> A new era of World Affairs Conference information technology infrastructure

## Local Development

### Setup

1. Install [Node.js 20.x.x](https://nodejs.org/en), [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation), and [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli).
2. Clone the repository locally.
   ```shell
   gh repo clone worldaffairsconference/worldaffairs.ucc.on.ca
   ```
3. Install dependencies.
   ```shell
   pnpm i
   ```
4. Copy `.env.example` into `.env` and fill in the environment variable values.

### Usage

- To start the Firebase (Firestore + Auth) emulator, run
  ```shell
  firebase emulators:start --import ./firebase/emulator-data --export-on-exit
  ```
- To start the development server, run
  ```shell
  pnpm dev
  ```
- To run the unit tests, use
  ```shell
  pnpm test:unit       # To run once
  pnpm test:unit:watch # To watch for file changes
  ```
- To run end-to-end tests, run
  ```
  pnpm test:e2e
  ```

### Source control

- All commit messages should be formatted according to [AngularJS's commit message convention](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines). This repository is [Commitizen-friendly](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli), so running `git commit` should automatically open a prompt to ensure conformity.
- Commits should **never** be pushed directly to the `main` branch, as this would bypass the testing phase. Instead, every code modification should be made as a pull request.
